Array
This folder contains programs related to array operations. These may include:

Basic operations (insertion, deletion, searching)
Advanced operations (merging, reversing, rotation)
Graphs
This folder contains graph algorithms and representations, such as:

BFS (Breadth-First Search)
DFS (Depth-First Search)
Graph traversals, shortest path algorithms, and more
Linked List
This folder includes various types of linked lists and operations:

Singly Linked List
Doubly Linked List
Circular Linked List
Linked list manipulation (insertion, deletion, traversal, etc.)
Queue
This folder includes different types of queue implementations:

Simple Queue
Circular Queue
Priority Queue
Deque (Double-ended Queue)
Sorting
This folder contains sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Selection Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Stack

This folder includes stack data structures and operations:

Basic stack implementation
Applications of stacks (e.g., infix to postfix conversion, postfix evaluation)
Tree
This folder contains tree data structures and algorithms:

Binary Tree
Binary Search Tree
AVL Tree
Tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
doubt.c
This file is for any code-related doubts or questions you have encountered while working on data structures and algorithms. It may contain experimental code or queries.
